	// Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements
	// alternately.
	//
	// For example, given two 1d vectors:
	//
	// v1 = [1, 2]
	// v2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
	// By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of
	// elements returned by next should be: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6].
	//
	// Follow up: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be
	// extended to such cases?
	//
	// Update: when k vectors are provided, what the results should be still
	// remain to be a question (you may refer to this post). So the following
	// notes do not focus on that now.
